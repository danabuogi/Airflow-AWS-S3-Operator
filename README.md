# Airflow-AWS-S3-Operator
•	The S3 Sensor waits for a file to exist. For instance, it waits for a file to exist in CSV such as in AWS when we don’t know the exact time the file will be available.
•	ETL with MinIO, can easily be applied to Amazon’s simple storage service (AWS S3) since MinIO is an object storage solution that provides Amazon Web Services S3-compatible API and supports all core S3 features. This implies that applications that can be configured to talk to MinIO can also be configured to talk to Amazon S3. Therefore, to connect to MinIO bucket, the AWS S3 API, which is included in airflow Amazon providers packages, is used.
•	MinIO is built to deploy on any infrastructure and in any cloud - public, private, or edge.
•	The MinIO service was set up with Docker containers, which aids in the cd process.
